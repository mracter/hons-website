	<h3 class="sans-light">DISTORTING SENSORY INPUT TO EVOLVE EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION</h3>
</article>

<article class="body">

	<p>Each robot was equipped with 7 sensors; 4 general-purpose proximity sensors and 3 special
sensors in front that could detect objects of one type only. Each special sensor was equipped
with an additional linear gain parameter âˆˆ {0.5, 1.0. 1.5} that could make objects seem closer
or further away than they actually were. Every possible 3-combination of the parameters was
generated. The robot controllers were Artificial Neural Networks evolved with Neuro-
Evolution of Augmenting Topologies in both genetically heterogeneous and homogeneous
teams. The experiment measured the task performance of the sensory-distorted robots
against a control on 3 foraging tasks, each requiring different levels of co-operation to
achieve satisfactorily.</p>

<p><b>Preliminary results showed that the best performing combination of linear parameters
for each task and team composition consistently performed as well or better than the
control. This suggests that empirical signal amplification may be a way to improve co-
operative performance in the collective foraging task.</b></p>
