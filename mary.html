<p>This project studied the performance of robotic agent teams in a simulated co-
operative foraging task, where the robotic agents did not communicate with each other using
any explicit message-passing protocols. It aimed to investigate the impact of augmenting
the strength of various environmental cues to the robotic agents on the evolutionary devel-
opment of cooperative behaviour.</p>

Specifically, the research studied the effects of varying
the linear transducer gain on typed sensors on the evolution of controllers that perform well
on a cooperative foraging task. The motivation was that distorting the environmental cues
to the robot, abstracted as complements of transducer gains on robotic agents, may aid in
the evolution of co-operative behaviour.</p>



<p>Each robot was equipped with seven sensors; four general-purpose proximity sensors and three special
sensors in front that could detect objects of one type only (Shown in Figure 2). Each special sensor was equipped
with an additional linear gain parameter âˆˆ {0.5, 1.0. 1.5} that could make objects seem closer
or further away than they actually were. Every possible three-tuple combination of the parameters was
generated.</p>

</figure>

<p>The robot controllers were Artificial Neural Networks evolved with Neuro-
Evolution of Augmenting Topologies in both genetically heterogeneous and homogeneous
teams.</p>

<p>The experiment measured the task performance of the sensory-distorted robots
against a control on 3 foraging tasks, each requiring different levels of co-operation to
achieve satisfactorily. All complements of linear parameters for the typed sensors were tested on six task setups, shown in Figure 2.</p>

<b>
<p>Preliminary results showed that there was a significant fitness dropoff from homogeneous to heterogeneous teams (See Figures 4 and 5). There was also a fitness dropoff that occurred as more co-operation was required for the task.</p>

<p>The best performing combination of linear parameters for each task and team composition consistently performed as well or better than the
control on all 6 task setups. This is promising, and suggests that empirical signal amplification may be a way to improve co-operative performance in the collective foraging task. </p>

<p>Additionally, the best performing combination of linear parameters was different for each task setup. This suggests that robotic agents may need to sense different types of objects differently according to the type of task they need to perform and/or the roles they play in the team.</p></b>
