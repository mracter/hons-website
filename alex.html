<article class="body">

	<p>The aim is to find the minimal agent sensor configuration (morphology) that still results in
	the evolution of effective co-operation. 8 morphologies were designed and tested by
	evolving controllers using Genetic Programming on a series of 3 variants of the foraging
	task.</p>
	
	<p><b>Experiment results showed that a morphology consisting of 3 ultrasonic sensors is
the simplest and most effective morphology in our test tasks, followed closely by 8
ultrasonic sensors.</b></p>
