<article class="body">
	<p>The aim of our research was to develop controllers for robotic agents that exhibit intelligent behaviour. One approach to creating such controllers is to manually design a set of heuristics to achieve the desired behaviour.</p>

	<p>As agents are made to perform more complex tasks, however, manually designing controllers becomes more challenging. Another approach is to automate controller design using Machine Learning (ML) methods.</p>

	<p>When multiple agents interact in what is called a Multi-Agent Simulation (MAS), ML methods become even more relevant as the interactions between agents causes an explosion in the state space size.</p>

	<p>Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a type of ML method where algorithms are refined or “evolved” using an iterative process, where candidate solutions are selected, recombined, mutated and tested each generation.</p>

	<p>A common approach when developing agent controllers is to simulate the robots in a virtual environment while the controller is refined, and then to “transplant” the controller into a physical robot.</p>

	<p>Agents are tested in a simulated task so as to assess their performance. In our case, that task was the collective foraging task which involves multiple agents seeking out resources in the environment and pushing those resources back to a designated area. This task can be rigged to require cooperation among agents by featuring larger resources that require multiple agents to push.</p>

	<p>Of interest to our research is the effect of agents’ <b>morphologies</b> on their performance in this task. The morphology of a robotic agent describes its configuration of sensors and actuators.</p>

	<p>We developed a high-performance Java-based simulator platform in which to run our experiments. Each group member formulated a separate hypothesis exploring different factors in agent morphology design and developed an EA-based method for evolving agent controllers.</p>
