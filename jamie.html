</article>

<article class="body">

	<p>A new evolutionary algorithm was developed that evolves agent controllers and
morphologies concurrently. This algorithm was built on top of a popular method known as
Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). Using the new algorithm, sensor
positions are refined and new sensors are added. This has the potential to create unique
morphologies that an experimenter would not have designed. The algorithm was tested
against agents with a fixed morphology designed to mimic a commonly used robot, the
Khepera III.</p>

<p><b>The proposed method was comparable to the fixed morphology method in cases that
required a medium level of co-operation but its performance fell behind in the case
where a high level of co-operation was required. Some of the evolved morphologies
were retested in agents with fixed morphologies but evolving controllers. The evolved
morphologies were shown to match the performance of the Khepera morphology in all
levels of co-operation while featuring fewer sensors.</b></p>
